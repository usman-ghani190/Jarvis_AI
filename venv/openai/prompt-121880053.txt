Dear [Manager’s Name],

I understand the importance of my responsibilities at work and I have already informed my colleagues to ensure that my tasks are covered during my absence. I will also ensure that any urgent projects or tasks are taken care of before I leave.

I have also informed my team about my absence and they are aware of my condition. I will make sure to keep them updated on my progress and will resume work as soon as I am fully recovered.

I kindly request for your understanding and approval for my sick leave application. I have been a diligent employee and I have never taken any sick leave in the past year.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope to be back at work soon.
