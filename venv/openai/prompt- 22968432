Dear [Supervisor’s Name],

I am writing this letter to inform you that I need to take a sick leave from work due to [reason for sick leave]. I have consulted with my doctor and it has been advised that I take [number of days/weeks] off from work to fully recover.

I have already informed my team and made arrangements for any urgent tasks to be completed in my absence. If needed, I am available to provide guidance and support remotely during this time.

I understand that my absence may cause an inconvenience to the company and my team, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I assure you that I have completed all my current tasks and have delegated my responsibilities to my colleagues.

I have also attached the necessary medical documents for your records. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I plan to return to work on [return date], unless my doctor advises otherwise. I appreciate your understanding and support during this time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
